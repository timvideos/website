#Become a GSoC student 2018!

Stefan Wallentowitz posted this on https://fossi-foundation.org/2018/02/12/gsoc – It applies to us too, we can’t say it any better, so here it is.

We are happy and honored to be part of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) again this year. We are a mentoring organization and serve as an umbrella organization for many open source and open hardware projects related to recording and live streaming.

Google Summer of Code is an excellent program for students to get a stipend by Google to work on open source projects. To start things off, we have prepared a list of project [ideas](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AGSoC).  As a student you are free to base your project on one of these ideas, but remember that it is your idea we are looking for, and you should come up with an idea that you want to work on. Your job is to write a realistic project proposal to show us that you have a good idea of the work involved, and discuss the idea with us to get feedback. Our job is to match you up with a suitable mentor.

As there are more student proposals than we have seats, a well-written project idea is important for us to judge whether we should choose you over someone else. It is also a good idea to get involved with the community early on to get a better feeling for what kind of project you want to do, and what already exists. For more general information about what it takes to be a GSoC student, there are several guides available on the GSoC site, for example [here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/manual).

Please get in touch with the project maintainers from the list of ideas or with other projects you like. We are happy to answer questions about the program and the application procedure at the timvideos@googlegroups.com mail list.
